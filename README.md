# Data-Entry-App
Data Entry Application (Student Application Edition)
This is a Student Data Entry and Retrieval Application created in Microsoft Excel. 
It was created as a first practice at making automated data entry applications. 

Data entered into the form on spreadsheet 'DATA ENTRY APPLICATION' will be submited into the 'MASTER DATA TABLE' when the submit button is pressed. 
After the data is submited the form will be reset. When the reset button is pressed, the form will also reset. 
These buttons were created using record macro, or record action. 

The Student Data Statistics on the 'DATA ENTRY APPLICATION' spreadsheet are live numbers that update whenever data is added to the 'MASTER DATA TABLE'. 

On the 'STUDENT APPLICATION FORM', a valid five digit number will recall and auto fill the students information in the application sheet. 
This completed form can then be printed by pressing the print button. The print button was also created using record macro. 

Pivot tables were created to analyze student data on the 'PIVOT TABLE' spreadsheet.

Charts were created off of these pivot tables to display and better understand the data.
These charts are within the 'PIVOT CHART' spreadsheet.
